# Hangman: Animal Themed


## Introduction

This game was developed during the my first project at General Assembly for the Software Engineering Intensive Bootcamp. I built an animal themed Hangman game that is user friendly for all device sizes! During this game, the user will try to guess the animal that the computer has automatically selected for them. Every time the user guesses a correct letter in the word, the computer will display that letter. If the user selects an incorrect letter, the computer will build a piece of the hangman structure. The user gets a total of 5 guesses before the hangman structure is built and reaches the lion! Afterwards, the user can reset the game by clicking the New Game button, and the computer will automatically select a new word for the user.

## Technologies

To build this game, I used HTML, CSS and Javascript through Visual Studio Code. 

## Reflection 

While building this game, I got the opportunity to truly learn the limitations of HTML, and where Javascript comes in to power certain parts of a web application. For example, I discovered that instead of building the boxes that display the length of the word to the user, I learned that I had to do that in Javascript rather than putting it in my HTML file, as the length of those boxes would change dynamically based off of the length of the chosen word. 

This was my first time working with Javascript after learning a few concepts in Unit 1 from the General Assembly bootcamp. My biggest struggle while building this game was understanding what to do within the Javascript to make my game functional; however, once I started putting small pieces together, I did find that it was easier to understand what I was doing as I read the code. 

An aspect that I really enjoyed during this project was creating the media queries at the end of the game and making it functional for the user across any device size. Flexbox and Grid was something that I struggled with when I first learned them, but as I was going through this project and applying the concepts, they really started to click for me. 


## Next Steps 

Future enhancements to this game will include providing different groups of animals to choose from, such as insects, mammals, reptiles, etc. The game would also include animals that have more than one word to describe them.
